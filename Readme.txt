TV program Schedule
We can make a weekly TV program schedule using the following method.
1.Make seven txt files for seven days of week which consist of the time as well as the show that's being broadcasted. 
2. User can choose a day and enter the time when he wants to watch a show.
3Program searches for all the entries of that time in that day's text file 
4. The program will then show the list of all programs that will be shown when user entered his time 
5. User will have to type the name of the program he wants to save in his weekly schedule.
6. Program asks the user if he'd like to go to the beginning of the program. If user goes back then he can make another entry in his schedule.
7. If user types the same time again, then he is given an option if he wants to replace the program he previously entered or append his previous schedule.
8. User can choose any option according to his will.
